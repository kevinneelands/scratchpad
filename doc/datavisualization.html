<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
General notes:<br/>
Here's my understanding so far:
<ol>
    <li>Individuals are children of their direct supervisor.</li>
    <li>A supervisor has one blank child node, the 'roles' node, and the children of that node are the roles that supervisor oversees.
    (the roles are the supervisors grandchildren)</li>
    <li>A role is the grandchild of the person who is responsible for determining if the role is carried out correctly.</li>
    <li>Mousing over an individual should highlight that individual and ALL their visible roles regardless of which supervisor a role is under.</li>
    <li>Mousing over a role should highlight the role AND the individual who has the role. (</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Questions:
<ol>
    <li>I was under the impression a role belongs to one individual.  In your example if there are three programmers under you the roles
    are "Programmer 1", "Programmer 2", "Programmer 3", corresponding directly to the individuals.</li>
</ol>
