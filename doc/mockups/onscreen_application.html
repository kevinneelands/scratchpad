<h3>On Screen Application</h3>
Simple mockups of how on - screen forms can work.  I think now we can safely use HTML 5 options to limit input fields
instead of relying on our own javascript, but have simple javascript that checks for blank fields also.
As time allows the input checking could be made more sophisticated.<br/>
These first two images show the form scrolling.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="std_image" src="application_form_1.png" />
<br/>
<img class="std_image" src="application_form_2.png" />
<br/>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="new_page">
While its safe to assume users will always want a monitor with a large screen for filling out the forms
(and, most likely, a real keyboard instead of the single-finger option on small devices )
they can be responsive, and if a minimum width is hit a horizontal scrollbar can appear as
shown in the image on the right.<br/>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img class="std_image" src="application_form_3_squeezed.png" /></td>
        <td><img class="std_image" src="application_form_4_horz_scroll.png" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<hr>
</div>
<div class="new_page">
For on-screen signing users may prefer a mobile device.  Allowing them to save forms in an intermediate state
is handy, and it would also allow them to save the form and then call them up on a mobile device with a touch screen
for the signature.  Image on the right has my signature I did with the mouse on an HTML 5 &lt;canvas&gt; widget.
<br/><br/>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img class="std_image" src="application_form_signature.png" /></td>
        <td><img class="std_image" src="application_form_with_signature.png" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Code-wise there's a few things that can be done to make certain creating new forms is not terribly time-consuming.<br/>
First, we can make full use of partial views
<pre>
<%= render :partial=> "scratchpad/standard_yes_no", :locals => {:prompt => "Is the company currently being sold or currently merging with another company?", :name =>"Q5" } %>
<%= render :partial=> "scratchpad/standard_yes_no", :locals => {:prompt => "Are any of the employees of the company currently on layoff in the U.S.?", :name =>"Q6" } %>
</pre>
and similarily organize the CSS in a way that makes alteration easy.  In this snippet 'std_form_div' and 'std_form_label' hold the CSS
settings pertinent to repeated portions of the forms, allowing the forms to have a 'theme'.
<pre>
&lt;div class="std_form_div"&gt;
  &lt;div class="full_width"&gt;
    &lt;div class="five_sixth_width std_form_label"&gt;
       If the answer to the above question is Yes, did the company layoff any employee from its previous U.S. location?
</pre>
